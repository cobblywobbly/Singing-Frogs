# Singing-Frogs
frogs do the darndest things

This is a quick little project for a class I'm doing around p5. 

It's an amalgam of many other people's work: 

1) The amazing library of p5.play supported by Paolo Pedercini (https://github.com/molleindustria)
2) Music and inspiration from this old Flash game of singing Swedish horses (https://www.solitaireparadise.com/games_list/singing-horses.html) 
3) The amazing froggy artwork of Cole Ott (https://www.instagram.com/p/4Z5WO3Mfoh/)
4) Pavarotti's "Vincero" solo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy4S9Jca8DQ)

It was super fun to do, and as you can see, is in no way my own. 
Please feel free to use the code, and remix it, but make sure to get permission from Cole for the artwork.
